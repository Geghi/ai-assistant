Build an AI Executive Assistant to replace
a human Executive Assistant
This is just a brief description of the problem I want to solve, you can add your own touch or
suggest optimizations for my circumstances.
Primary Challenge & Objectives
Core Problem: I work at a construction company, I excel at time management and prioritization
but struggle with task execution and delegation. I need a "live assistant" I can delegate tasks to
with simple commands like "can you get this done?"
Key Success Metrics: The AI assistant must demonstrably save time on task execution,
improve delegation efficiency, and maintain his relationship-first communication style.
Critical Workflow Requirements
1. Email Management & Triage System
● Daily Processing: Scan ~50 emails each morning
● CC Integration: All office communications are CC'd to me for awareness
● Priority Classification: Identify urgent vs. non-urgent items
● Construction Site Updates: Flag construction-related issues requiring immediate
attention
● Automated Responses: Draft follow-up emails after phone conversations
● Stakeholder Communication: Manage communications with realtors, buyers,
contractors
2. Appointment & Calendar Management
Critical Feature: Automated appointment rescheduling
● Example Scenario: When I need to reschedule a lunch meeting, the AI should:
○ Contact the other party automatically
○ Propose alternative times
○ Handle back-and-forth coordination
○ Confirm new appointment
● Preferred Meeting Times: 8:00 AM (I wake up at 5:30 AM)
● Emergency Handling: Recognize urgent situations requiring immediate attention
I want to control this assistant as if I am controlling a human executive assistant, like sending
voice notes or texts to whatsapp, and the automation executes on my orders.
Workflow Automation Examples
Construction Issue Management
1. Email arrives about construction site problem
2. AI classifies urgency level
3. If urgent: Immediately notify Charan + relevant site manager
4. If routine: Schedule for daily briefing
5. Auto-draft response acknowledging receipt
6. Track resolution status
Appointment Rescheduling
1. Charan requests meeting reschedule via voice/text command
2. AI contacts other party with polite rescheduling message
3. Proposes 2-3 alternative times based on Charan's calendar
4. Handles negotiation of final time
5. Sends confirmation to both parties
6. Updates calendar systems
Daily Email Processing
1. Scan incoming emails each morning
2. Categorize: Urgent/Important/FYI/Spam
3. Draft summaries for important items
4. Flag items requiring Charan's personal attention
